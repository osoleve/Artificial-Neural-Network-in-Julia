Writing a neural network with backpropagation in Julia

I'm writing this so I can learn and refer to it later, not so it can be used. Check out Flux.jl for production Neural Net stuff.  
If you play around with the code itself, be aware of the liberal use of italic math unicode variables in backprop.
